# PyBer_Analysis

#Purpose

Goal is to create ride share visualizations for PyBer to help stream line access to 
services and determine the affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

#Requirements
Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

#Results
Urban cities have the highest amount of rides, and rural cities have the least amount. Urban cities have the highest numbers of drivers with higher fares compared to rural areas.
The multiple-line chart monitors fare changes from January to April 2019. Cities experiences fare increases mostly during March. With urban cities experiencing the most fluctuation in overall price.
